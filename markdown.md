Markdown 101
===========


What is Markdown?
----------------

Markdown is a unique markup language that can easily be compiled to HTML. Markdown 
was designed to be easy to write, but also easy to read in its raw form; meaning 
that markdown is great for publishing content on the internet with.
[John Grubber ][ John Gruber Wiki ] invented markdown and intiailly released it
in about 2004, he has a great blog called [Daring Fireball][Daring Fireball]. 
[Aaron Swartz][Aaron Swart Wiki] had a lot of influence of the syntax of markup.
For those who don't know who Aaron Swartz is, he was one of the founders of Reddit.
Swartz is also one of the most well known Hacktavist and has incredibly sad story.
There is a great documentary on his life that I highly recommend called [The Internet's
Own Boy] [Internet's Own Boy].


Basic Syntax
------------

Markdown makes doing all the things needed for online publish extermely easy.

### Headers

Headers can be declared in a couple ways. Using # like this

```markdown
# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6
```

That line would then be complied to

```html
<h1> h1 </h1>
<h2> h2 </h2>
<h3> h3 </h3>
<h4> h4 </h4>
<h5> h5 </h5>
<h6> h6 </h6>
```

Alternatively h1 tags can be with "=" used as an underline and h2 can be declared
with '-'

```markdown
h1
==
h2
--
```

That line would then be complied to

```html
<h1> h1 </h1>
<h2> h2 </h2>
```
